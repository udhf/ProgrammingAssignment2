## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to
set the value of the vector
get the value of the vector
set the value of the inverse of a matrix
get the value of the inverse of the matrix 
## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)

}


## Write a short comment describing this function
The following function calculates the inverse of a matrix of the special "vector" created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been already calculated.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
 m <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(m)
        m
}
